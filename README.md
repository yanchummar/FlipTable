# FlipTable
A Restaurant Table Reservation App

FlipTable is an app that has a smooth user interface and functions as a Restaurant Table Reservation App, where you can add restaurants to your database and can be found in the app and for each reservation made through the app will be sent as a request to the restaurants.

Then the restaurants can find the request in the "FlipTable for Restaurants" app and then accept for reject the reservation request. These reservation requests are easily sorted and arranged in the restaurant's app and can be viewed anytime.
